# Recommendation System

RS (can be seen as function mappings) is to **FIND** relevance score used for ranking **GIVEN** user models (ratings, perferences, demographics and situational context) and items (description of item characteristics), **FINALLY** recommending items that are assumed to be relevant. **BUT** relevance might be context-dependent, and characteristics might be strictly applied to a single series items (diversity).

## Formal Model

* $X$ = set of customers
* $S$ = set of items
* $R$ = set of ratings
* Utility function $u: X \times S \leftarrow R$

## Key Problems

1. Gatering *known* ratings for matrix
    * Explicit way doesn't work well in practice, as you can't expect the user to provide
    * Implicit way to learn ratings from user actions (e.g., like, purchase, favourite)
2. Extrapolate *unknown* ratings from the known ones
3. Evaluating extrapolation methods

## Paradigms of recommender systems

1. Personalized recommendations by providing with **user profile and contextual parameters** (abbr. UC)
2. Collaborative recommendations by providing **community data and UC**
3. Content-based recommendations by providing **product features and UC**
4. Knowledge-based recommendations by providing **knowledge models, UC and product features**
5. Hybrid recommendations are combinations of various inputs and/or composition of different mechanism mentioned above

### Content-based recommendation

Main idea is to recommend items to customer $x$ similar to previous items rated highly by $x$. For every recommendation, we need both of item profiles and user profiles. Most content-based recommendation techniques well-applied to text documents. Nevertheless, content of items can also be represented as text documents.

* Structured: Each item is described by the same set of attributes (e.g., well-constructed tables)
* Unstructured: Free-text description

#### Item Profile
Item profile contains a vector of features (attributes or important words for text document). The features are normally chosen by TF-IDF

#### User Profile

User profile contains weighted average of rated item profiles that weight by difference from average rating for the item. The prediction heuristic is *cosine similarity*
$$ u(x, i) = cos(c, i) = \dfrac{x \cdot i}{||x|| \cdot ||i||} $$

#### Pros

* No need for data on other users (i.e., user needs to known what he/she like by providing with perferences)
* Able to recommend to user with unique tastes (i.e., the recommendation does not rely on other user)
* Able to recommend new and unpopular items (i.e., the recommendation does not related by others but user himself hence no first-rater problem)
* Able to provide explanations (i.e., feature vectors)

#### Cons

* Feature extraction is hard (but we have SIFT, TF-IDF)
* Can't recommend for users who don't have user profile (i.e., new users)
* Is limited on user profile (i.e., unable to exploit quality judegements of others)

### Collaborative Filtering

The most prominent method of generating recommendations well applied in:
* large, commerecial e-commerce sites
* many domains (i.e., documents, movies, images)
