# Recommendation System

RS (can be seen as function mappings) is to **FIND** relevance score used for ranking **GIVEN** user models (ratings, preferences, demographics and situational context) and items (description of item characteristics), **FINALLY** recommending items that are assumed to be relevant. **BUT** relevance might be context-dependent, and characteristics might be strictly applied to a single series items (diversity).

## Formal Model

* $X$ = set of customers
* $S$ = set of items
* $R$ = set of ratings
* Utility function $u: X \times S \leftarrow R$

## Key Problems

1. Gatering *known* ratings for matrix
    * Explicit way doesn't work well in practice, as you can't expect the user to provide
    * Implicit way to learn ratings from user actions (e.g., like, purchase, favourite)
2. Extrapolate *unknown* ratings from the known ones
3. Evaluating extrapolation methods

## Paradigms of recommender systems

1. Personalized recommendations by providing with **user profile and contextual parameters** (abbr. UC)
2. Collaborative recommendations by providing **community data and UC**
3. Content-based recommendations by providing **product features and UC**
4. Knowledge-based recommendations by providing **knowledge models, UC and product features**
5. Hybrid recommendations are combinations of various inputs and/or composition of different mechanism mentioned above

### Content-based recommendation

Main idea is to recommend items to customer $x$ similar to previous items rated highly by $x$. For every recommendation, we need both of item profiles and user profiles. Most content-based recommendation techniques well-applied to text documents. Nevertheless, content of items can also be represented as text documents.

* Structured: Each item is described by the same set of attributes (e.g., well-constructed tables)
* Unstructured: Free-text description

#### Item Profile
Item profile contains a vector of features (attributes or important words for text document). The features are normally chosen by TF-IDF

#### User Profile

User profile contains weighted average of rated item profiles that weight by difference from average rating for the item. The prediction heuristic is *cosine similarity*
$$ u(x, i) = cos(c, i) = \dfrac{x \cdot i}{||x|| \cdot ||i||} $$

#### Pros

* No need for data on other users (i.e., user needs to known what he/she like by providing with preferences)
* Able to recommend to user with unique tastes (i.e., the recommendation does not rely on other user)
* Able to recommend new and unpopular items (i.e., the recommendation does not related by others but user himself hence no first-rater problem)
* Able to provide explanations (i.e., feature vectors)

#### Cons

* Feature extraction is hard (but we have SIFT, TF-IDF)
* Can't recommend for users who don't have user profile (i.e., new users)
* Is limited on user profile (i.e., unable to exploit quality judegements of others)

### Collaborative Filtering

The most prominent method of generating recommendations well applied in:
* large, commerecial e-commerce sites
* many domains (i.e., documents, movies, images)

Basic idea behind the algorithm is utlize the ratings users provided for each catalog. Then recommend items using the "wisdom of the crowd". It also makes the assumption that customers who had similar tastes in the past, they are most likely to have similar tastes in the future.

1. Consider user $x$ to be recommeded (show preference to the system)
2. Find set $N$ of other users whose ratings are similar to $x$'s ratings (query database for similar preferences)
3. Estimate $x$'s ratings based on ratings of users in $N$ (recommendation)

### User-based Nearest Neighbour Collaborative Filtering

Same basic idea mentioned above. But the assumption is modified to, "user preferences remain stable and consistent over time", so the recommendation is valid.

1. Consider an user A and an item $i$ not yet seen by A
2. Find a set of users (peers/nns) who liked the same items as A in the past and who have rated item $i$
3. Predict like/dislike using proper way (e.g., average ratings)
4. Recommend among the best of items rated by peers yet A has not seen

#### Measure finding similarity

* **Jaccard similarity**: intersection over union, leading to ignore the value of rating, only maintaining the representation of which item have been rated
* **cosine similarity**: missing ratings (nought) has determined effect on ratings, whenever there is a nought, the significance of the other half would be 0 eventually (i.e., dot product)
    * One solution is substracting the row mean
* **Pearson correlation coefficient**: 
$$ sim(x,y) = \dfrac{\sum_{s \in S_{xy}} (r_{xs} - \overline{r_{x}}) (r_{ys} - \overline{r_{y}})}{\sqrt{\sum_{s \in S_{xy}} (r_{xs} - \overline{r_{x}})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{s \in S_{xy}} (r_{ys} - \overline{r_{y}})^2}} $$
