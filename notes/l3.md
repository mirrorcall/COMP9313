## Spark RDD Operations

1. **Transformations** is a function that produces new RDD from the
   existing RDDs.
   
   * Transformations are lazy *evaluation*
   
   > It takes RDD as input and produces one or more RDD as output.
   > Each time it creates new RDD when we apply any transformation.
   > Thus the input RDDs cannot be changed since RDD are immutable in
   > nature.
   >
   > Applying transformation built an RDD lineage, with the entire
   > parent RDDs of the finall RDDs. DAG
   
   1. Narrow transformation - In Narrow transformation, all the
      elements taht are required to compute the records in single
      partition live in the single partition of parent RDD. A limited
      subset of partition is used to calculate the result. (E.g.,
      `map(), filter()`)
   2. Wide transformation - In wide transformation, all the elements
      that are required to compute the records in the single partition
      may live in many partitions of parent RDD. The partition may
      live in many partitions of parent RDD. (E.g., `groupbyKey(),
      reducebyKey()`)
   
2. **Actions** is performed when working with the actual dataset.
